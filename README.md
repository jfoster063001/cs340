Client/Server Development

     Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs is crucial for long-term success. In the case of the CRUD Python module used to connect dashboard widgets to the database,
these principles are applied by writing modular, well-structured code with meaningful names and following coding conventions. Advantages include code reusability, improved maintainability
and readability, and the ability to abstract the complexities of database interaction.

As a computer scientist, problem-solving involves analyzing requirements, breaking them down, and implementing solutions with appropriate algorithms and data structures.
For the Grazioso Salvare project, this meant designing a suitable database schema, implementing CRUD operations, and integrating them with the dashboard widgets. Future database
projects will have to employ different techniques such as requirement understanding and analysis of the code, query optimization, and ongoing maintenance.
